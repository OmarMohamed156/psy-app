## Steps to run the program
- Download the expo go app on [appstore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) or [google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en&gl=US)
- Install Expo-cli on your computer using this command 
```
with npm:
npm install -g expo-cli
if you prefer yarn:
yarn add expo-cli
```
- Clone the repo and run the following command in a terminal opened inside the repos directory
```
using npm:
npm install or npm i
using yarn:
yarn install
```

- After the packages are done loading you can type the following command to start the server on wich the app will run. this will open a browser window that has a QR code on its bottom left corner.
```
expo start
```
- Then all you have to do is open your **Expo go** app on your phone, scan the QR code on the browser window that have just opened. the app will then bundle and download all necessary files (dont worry this wont consume alot of space on your phone) and the app will start on your phone.

### PRO-TIP (WINDOWS): if the lan connection doesnt work when scanning the QR code consider switching to tunnel connection or chang your wifi network to private and disable the firewall.
